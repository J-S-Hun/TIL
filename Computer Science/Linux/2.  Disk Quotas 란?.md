### 주제: Disk Quotas 란??
---
### 메모: 
- Disk Quotas is a feature of Linux operating systems that *allows you to limit the amount of disk space a user or group can use.* Users or groups can only use disk space up to a specified limit when quotas are set. 
- There are two types of quotas supported in Linux operating systems: file count quotas and disk space quotas. 
	- **File count quotas**
		- Limit the number of files that a user or group can create. 
	- **Disk space quotas**
		- Limit the amount of disk space that a user or group can use. 
- To set disk quotas, the first step is to enable quotas on the relevant disk. Then, you can use the command line utilities "quotacheck" and "quotaon" to set quotas for specific users or groups and specify the limits. 
- *It is important to note that disk quotas can have a negative impact on performance and it should be used carefully and only in specific cases*, like in a shared hosting environment where disk usage of different users needs to be controlled.
