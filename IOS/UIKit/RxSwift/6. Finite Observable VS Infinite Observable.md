### 메모: 
> Finite observables and infinite observables refer to the number of elements that an observable sequence can emit.
#### Finite Observable
- A finite observable is an observable sequence that emits a limited number of elements and then completes. 
- **It's important to note that finite observables must complete, otherwise, it can lead to memory leaks or unexpected behavior in application.** 
#### Infinite Observable
- An Infinite observable is an observable sequence that never completes. 
- Infinite observables must have a mechanism for stopping or disposing of the subscription, otherwise, it can also lead to unexpected behavior or performance issues.
#### Example
##### Finite 
~~~ swift 
let items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let observable = Observable.from(items)

observable.subscribe(onNext: { item in
    print(item)
}, onCompleted: {
    print("Completed")
})
// 1 
// 2 
// 3 
// 4 
// 5 
// Completed 
~~~
##### Infinite
~~~ Swift 
let observable = Observable<Int>.interval(.seconds(1), scheduler: MainScheduler.instance)

observable.subscribe(onNext: { time in
    print(time)
})
~~~
