### 주제: What is Equatable
---
### 메모: 
- `Equatable` is a protocol in Swift that defines equality between two instances of a type. It allows two instances of a type to be compared to see if they are equal.
- Types that conform to the `Equatable` protocol can be compared for equality using the equal-to operator (`==`) or inequality using the not-equal-to operator (`!=`).
- **Most basic types in the Swift standard library conform to `Equatable`.**
- By conforming to the `Equatable` protocol, a type can define its own custom definition of equality and determine if two instances are equal by providing an implementation of the `==` operator.
~~~ swift 
struct Person: Equatable {
    let name: String
    let age: Int
    
    static func == (lhs: Person, rhs: Person) -> Bool {
        return lhs.name == rhs.name && lhs.age == rhs.age
    }
}

let person1 = Person(name: "John", age: 30)
let person2 = Person(name: "Jane", age: 25)
let person3 = Person(name: "John", age: 30)

print(person1 == person2) // false
print(person1 == person3) // true
